It was the easiest way for a bunch of backend engineers to get the app quickly up and running and have it still be somewhat usable.\n\nAll was well and good, until it was time to upgrade Bootstrap. Because of the ways that Bootstrap and our own codebase are architected, it took a month of coding, a week of Q&A, and a week of post-release fixes, just to make the \"simple upgrade\".\n\nIt really shouldn't have to be that way for you, so in this talk, I'll share what I learned and what I'd recommend for your own CSS architecture."
