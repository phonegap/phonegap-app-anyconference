Because of the ways that Bootstrap and our own codebase are architected, it took a month of coding, a week of Q&A, and a week of post-release fixes, just to make the \"simple upgrade\".\n\nIt really shouldn't have to be that way for you, so in this talk, I'll share what I learned and what I'd recommend for your own CSS architecture.",
